## Introduction
**JFK Airport** is considering the weather conditions and this project is to help predict the possibility of precipitations, which involves using various local climatological variables, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, dew point, and pressure. This is a R-Analysis project of **JFK airport**. 

## Data sourcing
The data was collected by an NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York. 

## Task
My task is to provide a high-level analysis of weather data at JFK Airport. Stakeholders want to understand the current and historical record of precipitations based on different variables.
